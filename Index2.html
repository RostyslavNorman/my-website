    <h1>Welcome to My World</h1>
    <p>Hi! I'm Rostyslav, a first-year Computer Science student at South East Technological University (SETU) in Ireland. I love exploring new ideas, investigating, and pushing the boundaries of what I can learn. This website is a personal project for my "Website Development" class, showcasing my journey and interests.</p>
